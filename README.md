# GADS-2020-Phase2-Project
## Codifying two labs instructions on Qkwiklabs

> This project is part of the **Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program**. It involves codifying the instructions found in
the Qkwiklabs instructions on using Google platform resources covered during the program.

As part of this project, I codified the following instructions using markdown:

* [Working with Virtual Machines](./lab-translations/working-with-vms.md)
